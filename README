Unofficial boxee app for sputnik.dk VOD service.

# Requirements
	* Active user account at http://sputnik.dk
	* Silverlight capable system (windows, osx, perhaps atv)

# Installation
Add the repository at: http://boxee.motnok.dk/repo/ to your BOXEE repositories. After that you should see the sputnik app in available applications.

# Manual installation
If you dont want to add the repo, you can add the dk.motnok.sputnik folder to your ~/Library/Application\ Support/BOXEE/UserData/apps/ folder. 
Then add the following to your ~/Library/Application\ Support/BOXEE/UserData/apps/profiles/user/sources.xml: 

<source>
	<name>Sputnik</name>
	<path pathversion="1">app://dk.motnok.sputnik</path>
	<thumbnail pathversion="1">http://boxee.motnok.dk/boxee_thumb.png</thumbnail>
	<private>false</private>
	<adult>false</adult>
	<country-allow>true</country-allow>
	<country>all</country>
</source>

This should be enough to see in you apps

# Known issues
	* There is currently no log out option
	* Only programs in series are available. No movies or live channel at the moment
	* If you try to login, and cancel, you are not asked to login again. To be asked again, delete the registry.xml in you ~/Library/Application\ Support/BOXEE/UserData/profiles/user/apps/dk.motnok.sputnik/ folder on os x. On windows, it should be somewhere in "documents and settings".

Other bugs, let me know.
