Unofficial boxee app for sputnik.dk VOD service.

# Requirements
	* Active user account at sputnik.dk
	* Silverlight capable system (windows, osx, perhaps atv)

# Installation
Add the repository at: http://motnok.github.com/sputnik4boxee/ to your BOXEE repositories. After that you should see the sputnik app in available applications.

# Known issues
	* There is currently no log out option
	* Only programs in series are available. No movies or live channel at the moment
	* If you try to login, and cancel, you are not asked to login again. To be asked again, delete the registry.xml in you ~Library/Application\ Support/BOXEE/UserData/profiles/user/apps/dk.motnok.sputnik/ folder on os x. On windows, it should be somewhere in "documents and settings".

Other bugs, let me know.
